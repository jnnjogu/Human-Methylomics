## Background
### DNA Methylation
DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic mark that regulates multiple processes, including gene expression, genome stability and gene imprinting, and consequently disruption of DNA methylation can lead to developmental abnormalities. It is one of the most commonly occurring epigenetic events taking place in the mammalian genome. This change, though heritable, is reversible, making it a therapeutic target.
### Human DNA methylation
Variation of DNA methylation is common result in a variety of human body status. Of all epigenetic modifications, hypermethylation or hypermethylation, might effect the expression of diffrent genes, the organism body usually use this process to adapte to diffrent environemental states. Studies have been done in order to discover methylation profiles for diffrent cases, but none was trying to explore multiple cases profiles.
## Our Objective
In this project, we try to compare the methylation profiles of different human status in order to have a big overview of the involvement of methylation in diffrent processes
## Data acquisition
All data was downloaded from the [National Center of Biotechnology Informarions's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database.
